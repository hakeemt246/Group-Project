        <h2>Product Desirability and Demand</h2>
        <p>Due to the current changing business environment with the reality of the covid-19 pandemic there is a greater desirability and demand for a contactless
           business environment. Dream Cakes will be taking a proactive approach in relation to the industry since the industry at the moment still utilizes the approach
           where customers need to visit the store to place their orders and collect their goodies.
           <br><br>
           This approach provides a contactless way of ordering, paying and having your goodies delivered to your door as well as well as the traditional walk in system.
           <br>

           In this dynamic environment individuals wanted to have their cake fully customized as opposed to the basic icing and fondant flavours.
           Dream Cakes will also cater to individuals with gluten allergies as well as individuals who do not consume eggs.
           <br><br>

           Dream Cakes will meet the demands and desirability of the customers who are now more concerned with their health due to the current pandemic.
            Changes in society such as government regulations on business with social distancing protocols to name a few have resulted in the demand for
             business policy to change in relation to a contactless society. As a result of such changes Dream Cake will now be offering their products
             and services online.

      <h2>Industry & Competition Analysis</h2>

    <!--  <img src="table1.png"width="700" height="300" alt=""> -->
      <p>
        <b> Is the industry a realistic place for our new venture to enter?</b>
        <br>
        The cake industry is indeed a realistic place for our new venture because despite there
        being a high threat to industry profitability, there will always be a high demand for
        baked goods as it fulfills a need for food. While there are many other substitutes for
        food, cakes are an important food in society, as they are traditionally associated with
        celebration and special occasions.
        <br><br>
        <b> If we do enter the industry, can our firm do a better job than the
           industry as a whole in  avoiding or diminishing the impact of the forces that
           suppress industry profitability?
        </b><br>
        Through the utilization of technology the firm places itself in a unique position when
        entering the industry. The threats of substitute and new entrants will diminish as the
        online interface which allows customers to build their cake will be hard to replicate due
        to its capital intensive nature and unique user experience. Our novel branding and the
        establishment of stable distribution channels will also place us in a strong position to
        set ourselves apart from competitors. These and other plans serve as evidence that we
        can and will be able to avoid and/or diminish the impact of the forces that suppress
        industry profitability.
        <br><br>
    <!--    <b>Question 3: Is there a unique position in the industry that avoids or diminishes the
           forces that suppress industry profitability?
        </b><br>
        Technology enables us with more access and convenience in many areas. With this in
        mind, we are allowing anyone, to design any cake, from anywhere and choose between
         pickup and delivery. This strategy to take full advantage of technology will inevitably
         diminish the forces which seek to suppress the industry profitability such as Threat of
         Substitutes, as substitutes will lack the experience and convenience we are able to
         provide.
         <br><br>
         <b>Question 4: Is there a superior business model that can be put
            in place that would be hard for industry incumbents to duplicate?
         </b><br>
         The superior model that could be implemented is the bricks and clicks model. This
         refers to a company which has both an online and offline presence which allows
         customers to order online and then choose to pickup products a physical location. This
         model would be difficult to duplicate as it is capital intensive and also relies on a well
         organized and structured logistical system. -->
